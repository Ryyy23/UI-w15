Item 3: Practice Challenge 4
The final (practice) challenge for the semester!

Combining all your skills from the semester and working in small groups you must design a working connect 4 game. Your team will design your Firebase before commencing development.

You will then develop the app components individually without directly sharing code.

Your app must:

Create a 10x10 game board
Allow players to register
Allow players to take a turn (place an icon)
Manage player turns
Check for win conditions
Display win messages
Reset the board
Be styled appropriately
Plus each member of your team must do one of the following:

Allow players to message others in the game via live chat
Allow players to "match make" - displaying and prompting other online players 
Keep a leaderboard of all games won and show the winning state of the game
Update the game so it can handle up to 10 players on a dynamic board.
Use the following technologies/knowledge:

React
Firebase
CSS
JS
HTML
You will need to also demonstrate an implemented "Research" item from Week 15. This can be isolated on a single page but must be included in the project.


The firebase must connect all students in groups.
